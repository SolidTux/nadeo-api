About
---
This library provides an interface (or whatever you want to call it) for working with the [Nadeo API](https://webservices.openplanet.dev/). It handles **authentication** automatically but the request have to be build up manually by the user.

⚠️ This project is in very early development and might not be developed further ⚠️
