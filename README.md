About
---
This library provides an interface (or whatever you want to call it) for working with the [Nadeo API](https://webservices.openplanet.dev/). It handles **authentication** automatically but the request have to be build up manually by the user.

⚠️ This project is in very early development and might not be developed further ⚠️

Usage
---

Add this to your dependencies in the `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
nadeo-api = { git = "https://www.github.com/TgZ39/nadeo-api" }
```
