About
---
This library provides an interface (or whatever you want to call it) for working with the [Nadeo API](https://webservices.openplanet.dev/). It handles **authentication** automatically but API requests have to be build up manually by the user.

⚠️ This project is in early development ⚠️

Installation
---

Run
```sh
cargo install nadeo-api
```

or add this line to your `Cargo.toml` with the desired version:
```toml
nadeo-api = "0.2.2"
```
